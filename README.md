## Abstract

This code implements a time series forecasting model using the Prophet library for analyzing blockchain data. Leveraging the Python programming language and its powerful data analysis tools such as Pandas and Matplotlib, the code utilizes the Prophet library to predict the future trends of a specific metric, 'effect,' derived from blockchain transactions.

The dataset, sourced from blockchain events, is preprocessed to ensure data integrity and compatibility with the Prophet library. Time-related features are extracted, and the 'effect' column is aggregated to a daily level for modeling. The Prophet model is then trained on the prepared dataset, making use of its capability to handle daily data patterns and holidays.

The forecasted results are visualized, providing insights into the anticipated trends in the 'effect' metric over the specified time period. This application showcases the practical application of AI-driven time series forecasting in the context of blockchain analytics, offering a valuable tool for understanding and predicting patterns in blockchain transaction data.

This project serves as an example of how AI and machine learning techniques can be applied to analyze and forecast trends in dynamic datasets, contributing to a deeper understanding of blockchain behaviors and enabling informed decision-making in various domains.
